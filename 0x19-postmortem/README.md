# 🚨 Postmortem: The Airbnb Booking System Meltdown of [Date] 🚨

## 📌 Issue Summary 😱
On [Date], from **15:00 EET to 16:30 EET (Cairo Time)**, our beloved Airbnb booking system decided to take an unscheduled nap. As a result, reservations and payments failed spectacularly, leaving users frustrated and our support team drowning in emails. Approximately **60% of users** were affected, and we suspect the other 40% were just lucky. The root cause? A classic case of database deadlock—where our system got stuck in a loop of "No, you go first!" until everything crashed.

## ⏳ Timeline
- **15:00 EET** - Monitoring alerts screamed, "HELP! API failures are skyrocketing!"
- **15:10 EET** - Engineers rushed to investigate, fueled by panic and coffee.
- **15:20 EET** - Initial assumption: "It's the third-party payment gateway's fault!" (Spoiler: It wasn't.)
- **15:35 EET** - Realization dawns: "Oh no, it’s us."
- **15:50 EET** - Database engineering team called in. They were not amused.
- **16:10 EET** - Fix applied by tweaking transaction handling and database indexing.
- **16:30 EET** - System stabilized. Engineers sigh in relief. Users rejoice. Coffee supply critically low.

## 🔍 Root Cause and Resolution
Our reservation system got tangled in an inefficient transaction locking mechanism, causing a **database deadlock**. Imagine a room where two people try to go through the same door at the same time, but both insist the other should go first—forever. That’s what happened.

### 🛠️ How We Fixed It:
- Optimized queries to be less clingy (read: reduced locking conflicts).
- Adjusted database indexing to speed things up.
- Tweaked transaction isolation levels to prevent future logjams.
- Added retry mechanisms because sometimes, persistence is the answer.

## 🔧 Corrective and Preventative Measures
To ensure this never happens again (we hope), we’re making the following improvements:

- **Better Monitoring:** Alerts that tell us _before_ the system takes a nap.
- **Smarter Queries:** Reducing unnecessary locks so transactions don’t fight for space.
- **More Testing:** Simulating high-concurrency scenarios to catch these issues before users do.
- **Engineer Training:** So everyone knows that database deadlocks are evil incarnate.

### ✅ Action Items
- [ ] Modify transaction isolation levels to reduce conflicts.
- [ ] Add indexing on frequently accessed tables.
- [ ] Implement real-time alerts for deadlocks and API failures.
- [ ] Conduct a review meeting to laugh (and cry) about what happened.

💡 **Lesson Learned:** Our database is not a fan of overcrowding. Let’s keep things efficient, fast, and drama-free.

🎉 Thanks to our heroic engineers who fought the digital flames and brought Airbnb back online. Until next time (hopefully, there isn't a next time).
