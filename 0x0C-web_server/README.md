# 0x0C. Web server
In this project, I learned how web servers work and began using one. I was provided a personal server by Holberton School. I learned how to use scp and Fabric to transfer files to my server. Additionally, I completed a basic configuration of the server using Nginx.

The server is accesible at ``futuristicdevelopment.tech``
